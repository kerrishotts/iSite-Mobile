    <h2>January 12, 2012</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Big changes are a-foot...</li>
        <li>Changed all .php extensions to .html. Removed all .php files, as they were unnecessary. Entire demo now uses AJAX.</li>
        <li>Tweaked CSS and added support for INPUTs, SELECTs, and TEXTAREAs.</li>
        <li>Added a Text Entry example.</li>
        <li>Added caching via cache.manifest. Current behavior is to load all content from the server. Will change later.</li>
        <li>Fixed iScroll 4 behavior regarding SELECTs, INPUTs, and TEXTAREAs.</li>
        <li>Added a "Content" example, with the Bible as the source content. This is a black-on-white content area with a black
        bar anchored to the bottom containing Bible, Book, and Chapter SELECTs. Uses the Biblia APIs to provide a very simple Bible
        application proof-of-concept.</li>
        <li>Added a .htaccess file to specify the type of the manifest file.</li>
    </ul>
